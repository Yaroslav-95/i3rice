# Yaroslav's i3 rice

My own config files for my setup of i3wm/i3-gaps. I've used this configs on Manjaro, Arch and Void; however, it should work on any distro. Mostly based on the default i3 config of Manjaro, and Luke Smith's dotfiles. Most scripts were taken/modified from Luke Smith's dotfiles.

## Programs/Packages

There are scripts for installing all that's needed in Arch and Void in their respective folders. Arch's installation script might also work on Manjaro. If you are on another distribution you might use Arch's installation script to see what programs are being used.

### External packages

* st (my own fork)
* i3lock-color (AUR)
* ttf-ms-fonts (AUR)

## Theme(s)

GTK theme: Oomox-customized Materia Dark based theme (under .themes, might need to install the original Materia Dark theme)

Icon theme: Papirus
